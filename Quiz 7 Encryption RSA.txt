Electronic Code book (ECB)
- Each block of 64 plaintext bits is encoded independently using the same key.
- Secure transmission of single values (e.g., an encryption key)

Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
- The input to the encryption algorithm is the XOR of the next 64 bits of plaintext and the preceding 64 bits of ciphertext.
- General-purpose block-oriented transmission
- Authentication

Cipher Feedback (CFB)
- Input is processed s bits at a time. Preceding ciphertext is used as input to the encryption algorithm to produce pseudorandom output, which is XORed with plaintext to produce next unit of ciphertext.
- General-purpose stream oriented transmission
- Authentication

Output Feedback (OFB)
- Similar to CFB, except that the input to the encryption algorithm is the preceding DES output. 
- Stream-oriented transmission over noisy channel (e.g., satellite communication)
