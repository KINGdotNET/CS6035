Question 6 5 pts

Cryptographic hash functions generally execute faster in software than conventional encryption algorithms such as DES and AES.

	True
	False

Question 9 5 pts

Assuming that Alice and Bob have each other?s public key. In order to establish a shared session key, Alice just needs to generate a random k, encrypt k using Bob?s public key, and send the encrypted k to Bob and then Bob will know he has a key shared with Alice.
